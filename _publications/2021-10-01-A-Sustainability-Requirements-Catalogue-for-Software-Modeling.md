# Abstract
Sustainability poses key challenges in software development for its complexity. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability software requirements catalog. We started by performing a systematic mapping to elicit and extract sustainability-related properties, and synthesized the results in feature models. Next we used iStar to model a more expressive configurable catalog with the collected data, and implemented a tool with several operations on the sustainability catalog. The sustainability catalog was qualitatively evaluated regarding its readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain. The results were encouraging, showing that, on average, 79% of the respondents found the catalog “Good” or “Very Good” in endorsing the quality criteria evaluated. This paper discusses the social and technical dimensions of the sustainability catalog.
