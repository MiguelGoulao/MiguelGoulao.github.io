# Abstract
Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) advocates the use of models in every stage of development, leading to large number of models that need coordination, collaboration, and discipline management. Model Management (MoM) is a possible approach to manage inter-related collections of models among which Model Federation (MF) provides unique capabilities, like independence of development in individual modelling domains. There is currently a lack of studies about commonalities, variabilities, and gaps in MF approaches. In this paper, we propose a survey and a critical discussion of carefully selected papers about MF. From 59 contributions collected by experts in MoM, we selected, and classified, 23 papers. We extract the main trends we observed, according to our Classification. We then critically review the classification, and discuss important gaps found in our corpus. The survey results and artefacts are all available online.
