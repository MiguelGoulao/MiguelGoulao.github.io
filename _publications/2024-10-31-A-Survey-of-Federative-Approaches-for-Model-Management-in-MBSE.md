excerpt: 'Model Management (MoM) is a possible approach to manage inter-related collections of models among which Model Federation (MF) provides unique capabilities, like independence of development in individual modelling domains. In this paper, we propose a survey and a critical discussion of carefully selected papers about MF.'
