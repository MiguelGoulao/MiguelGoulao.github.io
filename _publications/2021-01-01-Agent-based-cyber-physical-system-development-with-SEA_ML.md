Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems explores modeling and analysis as crucial activities in the development of Cyber-Physical Systems, which are inherently cross-disciplinary in nature and require distinct modeling techniques related to different disciplines, as well as a common background knowledge. This book will serve as a reference for anyone starting in the field of CPS who needs a solid foundation of modeling, including a comprehensive introduction to existing techniques and a clear explanation of their advantages and limitations. This book is aimed at both researchers and practitioners who are interested in various modeling paradigms across computer science and engineering.
